## Problem 1: Find Crossover Indices.

You are given data that consists of points
$(x_0, y_0), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, wherein $x_0 < x_1 < \ldots < x_n $, and  $y_0 < y_1 \ldots < y_n$ as well.

Furthermore, it is given that $y_0 < x_0$ and $ y_n > x_n$.

Find a "cross-over" index $i$ between $0$ and $n-1$ such that  $ y_i \leq x_i$ and $y_{i+1} > x_{i+1}$.

Note that such an index must always exist (convince yourself of this fact before we proceed).


__Example__

$$\begin{array}{c| c c c c c c c c c }
i & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
\hline
x_i & 0 & 2 & 4 & \color{red}{5} & \color{red}{6} & 7 & 8 & 10 \\
y_i & -2 & 0 & 2 & \color{red}{4} & \color{red}{7} & 8 & 10 & 12 \\
\end{array} $$


Your algorithm must find the index $i=3$ as the crossover point.

On the other hand, consider the data

$$\begin{array}{c| c c c c c c c c c }
i & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
\hline
x_i & \color{red}{0} & \color{red}{1} & 4 & \color{red}{5} & \color{red}{6} & 7 & 8 & 10 \\
y_i & \color{red}{-2} & \color{red}{1.5} & 2 & \color{red}{4} & \color{red}{7} & 8 & 10 & 12 \\
\end{array} $$

We have two cross over points. Your algorithm may output either $i=0$ or $i=3$.


__(A)__ Design an algorithm to find an index $i \in \{ 0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ such that $x_i \geq y_i$ but $x_{i+1} < y_{i+1}$. 

Describe your algorithm using python code for a function _findCrossoverIndexHelper(x, y, left, right)_
  - `x` is a list of x values sorted in increasing order.
  - `y` is a list of y values sorted in increasing order.
  - `x` and `y` are lists of same size (`n`).
  - `left` and `right` are indices that represent the current search region in the list such that 0 <= `left` < `right` <= `n`
  
Your solution must use _recursion_. 

**Hint:** Modify the binary search algorithm we presented in class.

#First write a "helper" function with two extra parameters
# left, right that ddedscribes the search region as shown below
def findCrossoverIndexHelper(x, y, left, right):
    # Note: Output index i such that 
    #         left <= i <= right
    #         x[i] <= y[i]
    # First, Write down our invariants as assertions here
    assert(len(x) == len(y))
    assert(left >= 0)
    assert(left <= right-1)
    assert(right < len(x))
    # Here is the key property we would like to maintain.
    assert(x[left] > y[left])
    assert(x[right] < y[right])
    
    # your code here
    # binary search algorithm modified
    # finding middle index
    mid = (left+right)//2
    
    # if middle index = left then we found crossover
    if(mid == left):
        return mid
    
    # if middle index elements has x > y
    # then we need to change left to mid
    if(x[mid] >= y[mid]):
        return findCrossoverIndexHelper(x, y, mid, right)
    
    # if middle index elements has x < y
    # then we need to change right to mid
    elif (x[mid] < y[mid]):
        return findCrossoverIndexHelper(x, y, left, mid)

#Define the function findCrossoverIndex that wil 
# call the helper function findCrossoverIndexHelper
def findCrossoverIndex(x, y):
    assert(len(x) == len(y))
    assert(x[0] > y[0])
    n = len(x)
    assert(x[n-1] < y[n-1]) # Note: this automatically ensures n >= 2 why?
    # your code here
    return findCrossoverIndexHelper(x, y, 0, len(x)-1)

# BEGIN TEST CASES
j1 = findCrossoverIndex([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [-2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
print('j1 = %d' % j1)
assert j1 == 1, "Test Case # 1 Failed"

j2 = findCrossoverIndex([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [-2, 0, 4, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 8, 9])
print('j2 = %d' % j2)
assert j2 == 1 or j2 == 5, "Test Case # 2 Failed"

j3 = findCrossoverIndex([0, 1], [-10, 10])
print('j3 = %d' % j3)
assert j3 == 0, "Test Case # 3 failed"

j4 = findCrossoverIndex([0,1, 2, 3], [-10, -9, -8, 5])
print('j4 = %d' % j4)
assert j4 == 2, "Test Case # 4 failed"

print('Congratulations: all test cases passed - 10 points')

## Problem 2 (Find integer cube root.) 

The integer cube root of a positive number $n$ is the smallest number $i$ such that $i^3 \leq n$ but $(i+1)^3 > n$. 

For instance, the integer cube root of $100$ is $4$ since $4^3 \leq 100$ but $5^3 > 100$. Likewise, the integer cube root of $1000$ is $10$.

Write a function `integerCubeRootHelper(n, left, right)` that searches for the integer cube-root of `n` between `left` and `right` given the following pre-conditions:
  - $n \geq 1$
  - $\text{left} < \text{right}$.
  - $\text{left}^3 < n$
  - $\text{right}^3 > n$.

def integerCubeRootHelper(n, left, right):
    cube = lambda x: x * x * x # anonymous function to cube a number
    assert(n >= 1)
    assert(left < right)
    assert(left >= 0)
    assert(right < n)
    assert(cube(left) < n), f'{left}, {right}'
    assert(cube(right) > n), f'{left}, {right}'
    # your code here
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        mid_cube = cube(mid)
        if mid_cube == n:
            return mid
        elif mid_cube < n:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return right

# Write down the main function
def integerCubeRoot(n):
    assert( n > 0)
    if (n == 1): 
        return 1
    if (n == 2):
        return 1
    return integerCubeRootHelper(n, 0, n-1)

assert(integerCubeRoot(1) == 1)
assert(integerCubeRoot(2) == 1)
assert(integerCubeRoot(4) == 1)
assert(integerCubeRoot(7) == 1)
assert(integerCubeRoot(8) == 2)
assert(integerCubeRoot(20) == 2)
assert(integerCubeRoot(26) == 2)
for j in range(27, 64):
    assert(integerCubeRoot(j) == 3)
for j in range(64,125):
    assert(integerCubeRoot(j) == 4)
for j in range(125, 216):
    assert(integerCubeRoot(j) == 5)
for j in range(216, 343):
    assert(integerCubeRoot(j) == 6)
for j in range(343, 512):
    assert(integerCubeRoot(j) == 7)
print('Congrats: All tests passed! (10 points)')

###  (B, 0 points)

The inductive invariant for the function `integerCubeRootHelper(n, left, right)` that ensures that the overall algorithm for finding the integer cube root is correct is : 
  $$\text{left}^3 < n\; \text{and}\; \text{right}^3 > n$$


Use the inductive invariant to establish that the  integer cube root of $n$ (the final answer we seek) must lie between `left` and `right`. 

In other words,  let $j$ be the integer cube root of $n$.  

Prove using the inductive invariant and property of the integer cube root $j$ that: 

$$ \text{left} \leq j  < \text{right}$$

YOUR ANSWER HERE

### (C, 0 points)

Prove that your solution for `integerCubeRootHelper` maintains the overall inductive invariant from part (B). I.e, if the function were called with 

$0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n$, and  $\text{left}^3 < n$ and $\text{right}^3 > n$.

Any subsequent recursive calls will have their arguments that also satisfy this property. Model your answer based on the lecture notes for binary search problem provided.

## Problem 3 (Develop Multiway Merge Algorithm, 15 points).

We studied the problem of merging 2 sorted lists `lst1` and `lst2` into a single sorted list in time $\Theta(m + n)$ where $m$ is the size of `lst1` and $n$ is the size of `lst2`.  Let `twoWayMerge(lst1, lst2)` represent the python function that returns the merged result using the approach presented in class.

In this problem, we will explore algorithms for merging `k` different sorted lists, usually represented as a list of sorted lists into a single list.

### (A, 0 points) 

Suppose we have $k$ lists that we will represent as `lists[0]`, `lists[1]`, ..., `lists[k-1]` for convenience and the size of these lists are all assumed to be the same value $n$. 

We wish to solve multiway merge by merging two lists at a time: 

```
  mergedList = lists[0] # start with list 0
  for i = 1, ... k-1 do
      mergedList = twoWayMerge(mergedList, lists[i])
  return mergedList
```

Knowing the running time of the `twoWayMerge` algorithm as mentioned above, what is the overall running time of the algorithm in terms of $n, k$.

__Note that this part is not graded. You are encouraged to answer it for your own understanding.__
      

YOUR ANSWER HERE

__(B)__ Implement an algorithm that will implement the $k$ way merge by calling `twoWayMerge` repeatedly as follows:
  1. Call `twoWayMerge` on consecutive pairs of lists `twoWayMerge(lists[0], lists[1])`, ... , `twoWayMerge(lists[k-2], lists[k-1])` (assume k is even). 
  2. Thus, we create a new list of lists of size `k/2`. 
  3. Repeat steps 1, 2 until we have a single list left.

def twoWayMerge(lst1, lst2):
    # Implement the two way merge algorithm on 
    #          two ascending order sorted lists
    # return a fresh ascending order sorted list that 
    #          merges lst1 and lst2
    # your code here
    merged = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(lst1) and j < len(lst2):
        if lst1[i] < lst2[j]:
            merged.append(lst1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(lst2[j])
            j += 1
    while i < len(lst1):
        merged.append(lst1[i])
        i += 1
    while j < len(lst2):
        merged.append(lst2[j])
        j += 1
    return merged

        return list_of_lists
    ret_list_of_lists = []
    k = len(list_of_lists)
    for i in range(0, k, 2):

## Solutions to the Conceptual (Non Coding) Questions

### Problem 1B 
Note that the running time of _findCrossOverIndexHelper_ for inputs $x,y$ of size $n$ is $\Theta(\log(n))$. This is because, each iteration of the algorithm halves the search region and the algorithm terminates when the search region has size $2$. This requires at most $\Theta(\log(n))$ iterations by the same argument as that presented for binary search in the lecture video.

### Problem 2B



#### The reason we can conclude $\text{left} \leq j < \text{right}$ is : 



We note that since $j$ is assumed to be integer cube root of $n$, we have
$j^3 \leq n$ and  $(j+1)^3 > n$. We have $\text{left} < j+1$ and likewise $\text{right} > j$. Therefore, $\text{left} \leq j < \text{right}$.

### Problem 2C

~~~
    mid = (left + right)//2
    if (cube(mid)  <= n and cube(mid+1) > n):
        return mid
    elif (cube(mid) > n):
        return integerCubeRootHelper(n, left, mid) # Call 1
    else:
        return integerCubeRootHelper(n, mid, right) # Call 2
~~~

If Call 1 happens, we note that   `cube(mid) > n`. However, `cube(left) < n` is already true since the value of `left` is unchanged. Thus Call 1 satisfies the invariant.

Note that Call 2 will satisfy the property because  `cube(right) > n` and the call will only happen if
`cube(mid+1) <= n`. This implies that `cube(mid)< n`. Therefore, we conclude that `Call 2` will satisfy 
the invariant, as well.


### Problem 3A

The overall running time is $\Theta( n \times ( (k-1) + \cdots + 1))= \Theta(n \times k^2)$

### Problem 3C

At iteration $i$, the list of lists has size $k/2^{i-1}$ with each element of size $n \times 2^{i-1}$. The number of merge operations is
$k/2^i$ with each merge operation taking $n \times 2^{i}$ time. The overall work done at the $i^{th}$ iteration remains $k \times n$. There are $\Theta(\log(k))$ iterations in all. Therefore, the overall complexity is $\Theta(n k \log(k))$.
